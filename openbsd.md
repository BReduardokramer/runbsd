# OpenBSD

Forked from NetBSD 1.0, the focus of OpenBSD is security. The source code for
OpenBSD was made publicly available on 18 October 1995 via anonymous CVS. The
first release was version 1.2 which shipped in July 1996, followed by the 2.0
release in October 1996. OpenBSD releases happen every six months, usually in
April and October each year with a support duration of one year for each
release.  The project is home to many components which see wider use outside of
OpenBSD, such as OpenSSH, PF (firewall), LibreSSL and
[others](http://www.openbsd.org/innovations.html).
