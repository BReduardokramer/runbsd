# NetBSD

NetBSD was the first of the modern variants that is still actively
developed.  It started out life as a fork of 386BSD. The focus of
NetBSD is portability which not only makes porting to new hardware
easier (currently supporting over 60 different ports across many
CPU architectures).  Everything from a VAX, ARM & MIPS Windows CE
based PDAs to a Sega Dreamcast and many other systems are supported
and able to run the latest version of NetBSD. There is even a
[toaster which runs
NetBSD](https://www.embeddedarm.com/software/arm-netbsd-toaster.php)
The focus on portability also makes reusing components on other
operating systems easy.  For example the packaging system (forked
from FreeBSD (which we will talk about next)) supports over 20
operating systems.  This enables a consistent toolset to be used
regardless of operating system.

Some of the highlights of NetBSD include [ATF (Automated Test
Framework)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Testing_Framework),
unprivileged builds and portable build infrastructure using build.sh.

Automated Test Framework, as the name suggests is used for automated
tests of the source code to discover regression in the code base
in an automated manner.  Results can be found on the [NetBSD release
engineering page](http://releng.netbsd.org/test-results.html).

Unprivileged builds allow a user to not only build a copy of the
operating systems without elevated privileges, but they can also
build and install software from pkgsrc in a location they have write
access to (by default, in a prefix under their home directory).

build.sh, the build framework, allows NetBSD to be built on any
modern POSIX compliant operating system. Freeing the person to use
a operating system of their choice to build releases.
