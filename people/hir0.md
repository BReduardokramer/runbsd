# Tom Atkinson runs OpenBSD

My journey to [OpenBSD] is one of pure luck.  One saturday afternoon
in summer of 2016, I was browsing a bookshop when I came across a
copy of [Absolute OpenBSD]. It was cheap enough for me to afford
on a student's budget, so I bought it, got home, pulled out my
trusty T410 and followed the advice to get a fully functional OpenBSD
machine.  I've never looked back, so thanks
[@mwlucas](https://bsd.network/@mwlucas).

When I read that book, one of the things that struck me is how much
it focused on doing things the right way, not the quick way. I'm
normally a very impatient person and, strange though it may sound,
OpenBSD has helped me control that a bit more.  Shortly after, I
started getting involved with the community, which I had avoided
in the Linux community because their differences in opinion tend
to be steadfast and no manner of logical arguments tended to affect
their opinions in the slightest.  I strongly believe that a good
community fosters a good environment in which to develop a project
at it's best and I strongly believe that OpenBSD and the wider \*BSD
community have achieved an almost perfect community in which to
grow the projects.

Unlike many of these other stories, I can't really talk about BSD
in my work, because I've not long graduated university (one month
at the time of writing) but I can talk about my hobby project with
OpenBSD and my future job with OpenBSD as well.  I have long held
an interest in data and data visualisation and so in 2017, I started
freelance development of custom data visualisation platforms built
on OpenBSD using [BCHS](https://learnbchs.org) as a basis for them.
This generally involves taking long, codified log files and taking
them apart, classifying them and displaying the data in a user
friendly way. I'm not really a web developer so when I came to my
final exams in summer 2018, I hung up that hat and decided to start
a new learning experience once I had a job.

My job is something that I have been looking forward to for the
past six months since I got the offer. Two of my true passions in
technology are networking and security.  OpenBSD is exceptionally
good at these so what a brilliant platform to base my work on.  I
have got a job which I am yet to start (but massively looking forward
to) as a vulnerability researcher for networked devices. This means
writing low level networking code of the type I admire from the
OpenBSD base to attempt to take advantage of newly discovered
vulnerabilities in networked products. Part of my responsibility
is to find vulnerabilities in networking devices, such as routers
and IoT devices, and the other part is to develop systems for, and
produce, advisories to clients about suitable replacements.  This
means a chance to spread OpenBSD to more people as I develop my
advisories on top of OpenBSD. This might involve suggesting a whole
package solution in which I configure them a device to replace an
insecure off the shelf piece of hardware or working with their IT
team to work out how OpenBSD could more reliably support their
needs.

My tech needs are very small so I tend to work with vim(1), firefox(1)
and mutt(1) open on a normal day, using [cwm(1)] as my window
manager.  I've not done a lot with maintaining my own servers but
I plan on doing so shortly, so I might have more tech to add soon.

I love to learn and there are probably many people I don't know yet
who have a lot of interesting things to say that I'd love to hear
so please come and talk to me on [Mastodon](https://bsd.network/@hir0)
preferably, or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hir0pr0tagonist) if
you don't use Mastodon because I would love to know what you have
to teach me.
