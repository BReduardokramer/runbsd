# Anton Kolomyeytsev runs BSD

Greetings and salutation. My name is Anton.
I'm CTO/co-founder at StarWind and Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP 2014 and 2015).

I've been keeping an eye on <a
href="https://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> since support for Sun's <a
href="http://http://open-zfs.org/wiki/Main_Page">ZFS</a> has been
committed to FreeBSD 7. I always have an interest in UNIX way
to implement everything, hardware support, storage and networking
options, and features.</p>

To start with, you should know that StarWind is a software-defined
storage company. By this I mean that we have developed our software
solution that presents storage in different ways (i.e., over SMB3, NFS,
iSCSI & iSER) mostly for Microsoft ecosystem. That's actually why the
first interest in FreeBSD for me was storage.

Well, that was the way how it stated. Today at StarWind we have
FreeBSD running on amd64 workstations as a desktop OS for sales and
marketing teams. It also runs as a server OS featuring ZFS on Dell R720
and R730 servers used as file and backup repositories. Over the last
couple of years, we also deployed <a
href="https://www.pfsense.org">pfSense</a> appliances (XG-7100 HA) as
firewall, router, and VPN appliances. <a
href="https://www.openbsd.org/">BSD</a> is just everywhere! If you're
thinking of playing around with BSD, I highly recommend you to give it a
try. Sure, it will be a bit unusual, but certainly in a good way. Well,
I'm a happy FreeBSD user ever since.
