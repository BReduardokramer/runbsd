# Ashe runs BSD

I'm Ashe, a.k.a. `@kivikakk`. I'm a senior systems engineer at
[GitHub](https://github.com), where I work on things related to
Markdown and&nbsp;[VFS&nbsp;for&nbsp;Git](https://vfsforgit.com).

Programming was a hobby for me since I was young, usually derivatives
of BASIC, and occasionally messing around with some scripting
languages. It was in the early 2000s that I discovered Linux and
its suitability as a playground for developing my skills; back then
I was using Red Hat 7.1 and the [Linux Programming
Bible](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0764546570) by John Goerzen (of
Debian fame)---an absolutely amazing text that is single-handedly
responsible for my becoming a career programmer.

As I progressed into my career, then, Linux was naturally my system
of choice. I eventually moved onto Ubuntu and then Debian as my
distribution of choice, but there was no question that Linux was
the best choice for the range of tasks I undertook; it served well
as my desktop, and as far as I was aware, was the only option for
the server outside Windows Server or mainframes.

In 2008 I landed a job where using Mac-based systems was mandatory,
and so I had to put aside my criticisms of Apple and finally use
one of their products. It was a bit bewildering at first---the
system behaved like one I knew in many ways, but differed in many
others. It was the first time I experienced the difference between
Linux and UNIX. In my mind I maintained that the differences were
unpleasant, and that Linux on the desktop would be much better.
(Any year now.)

Over time, my use of Linux outside headless servers dwindled, and
I spent all my personal computing time in macOS (or OS X as it was
then known). My Linux-specific knowledge also began to recede,
especially with big changes in the scene, like systemd. It felt
like the required reading to operate Linux just kept ballooning,
and with a full-time job and family, I didn't care to keep up.

Since then, I operated various VPSs for personal services for my
family and friends, but I could never quite be sure that I had a
full handle on what I was operating. I'm used to developing and
maintaining an intimate understanding of systems I build, in the
more general sense of software systems, but it was just not feasible
for this stuff I was operating in my spare time. I didn't want to
have to spend a whole lot of time learning the new hotness.

At some point I remembered the BSDs exist. I picked [OpenBSD] to
try for both its security and minimalist stances---I needed a server
OS specifically, as my personal computer remains on macOS for work
purposes. [FreeBSD] was the other system I gave serious thought
to, but OpenBSD won out on both points of consideration.

It took maybe two months of operating a VPS (and submitting some
patches) to feel like I was acquainted with the whole system---there
have been very few surprises, and at every point it's been rock
solid. Now I can be found submitting patches to projects here and
there to ensure OpenBSD compatibility where possible :) Similarly,
I add OpenBSD as a target to build for (on top of Linux and macOS)
on my own projects. I never wonder where the line between Linux and
UNIX is any more ;)
