# Ian Darwin runs BSD

I discovered [OpenBSD] years ago and have run it on my laptop, desktops,
and server(s) ever since.  The number of softwares for which I need to
boot into a proprietary OS is small and continues to shrink.  OpenBSD is
a "real Unix" similar to the ones I met at University, it is minimalist,
it doesn't randomly accept every contribution without regard for quality
and consistency, but does change coherently, with a reasonable (six
month) release cycle, and in time to keep up with (and often ahead of)
the threats of a hostile internet.  I've since contributed some ports
and for a long time helped run GTABUG.  I can not imagine making any
other OS my main squeeze anytime soon.
