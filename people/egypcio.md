# egypcio runs FreeBSD

Brazilian born and raised in
[Fortaleza](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=fortaleza&ia=images&iax=images)
with roots in Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, instead of samba and
soccer I was that kid playing with a [TK
85](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TK_85) and learning different
languages as hobby. During high school times I've got motivated by the
use and benefits of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) --- some of you
might remember [Debian Potato](https://www.debian.org/releases/potato).

Since the past 5 years I'm working to get more Privacy-Enhancing
Technologies (PET) support working on BSD operating systems --- as
FreeBSD ports committer, most of the work is related to it. These
efforts brought me to the [TorBSD Diversity Project
(TDP)](https://torbsd.org/2016/12/17/welcome-aboard-vinicius.html) and
made me a [Core Team member of the Tor
Project](https://www.torproject.org/about/corepeople.html.en#egypcio) as
well. I'm also behind the reborn of the [Brazilian OpenBSD Users Group
(OpenBSD-BR)](https://openbsd-br.org).

Why not [NetBSD] or [OpenBSD]?  What about [DragonflyBSD]?  Today it's
still not easy to describe exactly what brought me to [FreeBSD] in one
word. I can't just pick one single feature and put it as the holy grail
for everything - that would be unfair with other operating systems that
I also [run](https://twitter.com/openbsd_br/status/842417764501458944)
and
[support](https://twitter.com/HenningBrauer/status/741485723778453504).
I mean: there wasn't one single time that running FreeBSD on my laptop
or on any server that got me mad or disappointed about doing so ---
maybe worth it to say that I'm not a gamer. The operating system works
rock solid, the project and its documentations are well maintained, the
people care about the community and both are in touch with each other to
get new features and hardware support working. Should I talk about the
license, the great companies that adopted it, the
researches/products/solutions it empowers, the standards it follows, the
certifications it's compliant to?  Running it on my workstation and
laptop is also an easy call for me as ports committer - working with
Poudriere and the Ports Collection, or troubleshooting base's stuff
without the need of running a virtual machine is very handy.

When FreeBSD landed on hardware like RaspberryPi and BeagleBone I almost
did not sleep those days, but had [lots of
fun](https://www.bsdcan.org/2016/schedule/events/658.en.html). I
remember that I presented an use case for a cross-compiling setup
running FreeBSD and Poudriere together with QEMU support during one of
the 'Compilers 101' classes at the tech institute where I graduated from
([Instituto Federal de Educa&#231;&#227;o, Ci&#234;ncia e Tecnologia do
Cear&#225; --- IFCE](https://www.ifce.edu.br)) --- there I also talked
about KAME/IPv6 on FreeBSD and recommend the net/sysadmins to use it to
handle routing and packet filtering. One of the official FreeBSD mirrors
in Brazil was running thanks to IFCE --- it was [the only one in Brazil
serving the /snapshots
folder](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-hubs/2012-January/002431.html),
by the way.

Time flew, I moved to Germany a while ago and now I work for a company
that makes [massive use of
FreeBSD](https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/testimonial/cleverbridge).

It was like yesterday when: I ran `sysinstall` for the first time and
upgraded my machines using `cvsup`, I was subscribed to the [FreeBSD
Users Group Brazil (FUG-BR)](http://fug.com.br) mailing list answering
more than asking, I saw myself giving talks related to BSD operating systems,
facilitating tutorials and writing articles about them and getting people
to know their features and what they are capable of. Some time in between I
engaged in a great effort to translate the OpenBSD FAQ and the FreeBSD
Handbook to Portuguese, than I helped to review and update a book
chapter about network and [Internet services powered by
FreeBSD](https://www.amazon.com.br/FreeBSD-Poder-Servidores-Suas-M%C3%A3os-ebook/dp/B00FFZOE8Y).
One day in 2015 I woke up and I was organizing [the very first
international BSD conference in
Brazil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTIoTI0aK5g)!

That's all folks! RunBSD ]:-)<br>
