# Adam Wo&#x142;k runs OpenBSD

It all started naturally, there I was chipping away at piles of
code of a legacy core banking system written in Oracle PL/SQL when
[heartbleed happened].

I was following the news which quickly converged into the same
thing, complaining on the quality of the OpenSSL code base. Then
by some weird twist of fate I stumbled upon some CVS commits in the
OpenBSD project, and lo and behold while everyone was bitching how
bad the code is&mdash;the OpenBSD team was hard at work putting it
into shape.

That was 14th of April 2014, I remember because I [posted that to
G+].

I really felt connected with that. They were ripping through thousands
of lines of legacy code and ripping it out&mdash;same thing as I
did daily for my last 3 months at work.

I wanted to get involved. I subscribed to the mailing lists and
started following the discussions daily. Installed OpenBSD in a
qemu instance on my machine and started learning it that way.  Not
long after, my wife donated her old MSI Wind i386 notebook (she
also now runs OpenBSD as her daily driver!) on which I happily
installed OpenBSD and started using it as my daily driver outside
of work. I also ordered my first OpenBSD CD (5.6).

The first big project I undertook was [porting the Otter-browser].
I learned a lot from it and it even resulted in some additional
patches showing up for qt5. The replies I got on and off list after
[submitting the port] were truly valuable. Each step I took as a
newbie validated that my personal beliefs align with the processes
and mentality the project adopted.

I continued [rolling with snapshots] until I got [a new laptop] in
April it was memorable because the built in ethernet card didn't
work out of the box. I was extremely surprised when several developers
jumped in, helped diagnose, debug and fix the issue. I remember
thinking back then how unrealistic it would be to have core Linux
kernel developers work so directly with a user.

I kept porting new things, helped testing diffs and new port
submissions. Started running OpenBSD on my server. Ran a bunch of
interviews with developers for the 20th anniversary of the project
for a Polish news site.

Finally, one day of Febuary 2016 I received an invitation to join
the ranks as a developer. Shortly after I [attended the g2k16
hackathon]&mdash;I never learned so much in such a short period of
time, the event was simply amazing. Everyone was extremely nice and
I knew that's THE community I want to be an active part of.

I [continue hacking] on OpenBSD whenever I can, most recently by
growing [a community around gaming] on the platform and prior to
that with a short project revolving around [reading the code daily]
with a group of people.

You can be sure of one thing, my involvement with the project will
only grow with time&mdash;as my life runs with OpenBSD.
