# Pau Amaro Seoane runs OpenBSD

As many people out there, my first contact with a PC was with
Windows. More precisely, DOS. I am talking here about PCs, because
the real first computing device that got into my place was a ZX
Spectrum 48k (and later even a 128k one!). I cannot count the hours
that I spent loading into the memory of the device programs, as
e.g. computer games like manic miner. The abhorrent and cacophonous
data loading via a cassette tape became something so familiar that
I now feel nostalgic when I look at videos of the process.

In spite of that poor memory, I learnt BASIC and some LOGO with it.
I all was influence of my father, who was working at IBM with punched
cards on computers as big as a wall and with so few memory that,
after installing the compiler, they had some 4k to work with.

Many years later, my father thought that I would be a good idea to
buy a PC for me. That machine came with DOS and, later, the GUI
came, with windows 3.11 and it was interesting to see how you could
arrange windows in this or that shape.

However, I always felt like I was nothing but an extension of the
computer. "Install this", "Press enter", "Accept conditions", etc.
Somehow I felt more free using the Spectrum than that i386. I also
had the feeling that, somewhat, I had learnt more with the Spectrum
than with that much more powerful PC.

At that moment, I learnt about something called "linux". I borrowed
a laptop, made a partition, and installed what I believed it was
Caldera Linux on it. It might sound trivial now, but we're taking
of 1995 or so, and I had to create my own /dev on the system and
play with cylinders and blocks when doing the partition. I suffered
a lot, I spent hours on it, I could not erase the linux partition
later to gave my friend her full Windows drive back and... I loved
it!

Unfortunately, my impression is that since the appearance (or should
I say the apparition) of Ubuntu, Linux is now what Windows once
was. Everything is now "easy", "quick", it "just works" and it was
not challenging any more. Moreover, "interesting" programs, such
as e.g. Skype, Flash, are available in binary files for Linux, and
graphic acceleration companies have "drivers" for it, too.

In some moment of confusion, I even got a MacBook. I returned it
after three months of usage, because it was impossible to work with
it (for me, I know this is personal). The MacBook makes a very nice
Christmas tree with all of that glowing and lights. I am talking
in jest, of course. I could not feel comfortable without having
total control. This is a proof of my desperation during those
months...  read and cry.

Since those blobs are binary data, you cannot read them. They usually
contain bugs and make your laptop break, they might in principal
(if you are paranoid like me) contain spyware, such [as proven in
the recent versions of Skype (Microsoft is
listening!)](http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Skype-with-care-Microsoft-is-reading-everything-you-write-1862870.html).
Ubuntu is also sending your personal information to the bad, bad
guys, BTW.  Also, in
2016 it was reported that the Linux kernel had [a bug lurking for
nine years, with a flaw giving untrusted users unfettered root
access](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/10/most-serious-linux-privilege-escalation-bug-ever-is-under-active-exploit/#p3).

In 2004 I discovered OpenBSD, and I felt straight away at the right
place. Dedicated programmers committed and [extremely correct in
their
coding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openbsd#Security_and_code_auditing)
and
[ethics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openbsd#Open_source_and_open_documentation).
Moreover, they are intelligent people with clear, concise answers
to well-posed questions.

It is difficult to abandon things that "just work", but, on the
other hand, and from a personal standpoint, the reasons why I use
OpenBSD whenever I can (i.e. on e.g. my laptop) are the following:

- The installation takes some 5 minutes
- It's extremely [secure](http://www.openbsd.org/security.html)
- It does not suffer of that common illness of many OS's: [regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_regression)
- The [documentation](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/) is excellent
- You understand what the OS is doing
- It's challenging and makes you think
- A top will usually tell you that X is taking about 0.1% of the CPU

Of course, this isolates you from a lot of "communities" but, taking
into account my mild misanthropy, I am fine with that.
