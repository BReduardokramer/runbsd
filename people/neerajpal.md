# Neeraj Pal runs BSD

I'm Neeraj (a.k.a. bsdboy, Neeraj Pal).  My career track has been
mostly in system/network administration and computer security.

Initially, for four years, I had HP Pavilion M6 laptop, but a sad
part was I couldn't install [OpenBSD] on it, because of a RAID
driver issue. Then, in December of 2017 I bought ThinkPad T470 and
managed to install OpenBSD on the real hardware and was very happy
with that.

I was introduced to OpenBSD and FreeBSD out of curiosity. One of
my friend, who is currently working as a SAS Software Consultant and
also a system security enthusiast, had challenged me to setup
OpenBSD with Fluxbox WM and OpenOffice in 2015. At that time I was
learning about managing servers and their security.

I tried OpenBSD on QEMU and it felt a little bit difficult to install
Fluxbox with SLiM login manager. If I remember correctly there was
an issue with the mouse pointer.  Later [Peter N. M.  Hansteen](pitrh.html)
and other members of the community from [OpenBSD public
group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2210554563) helped me.

My favorite BSD is OpenBSD and I love using it because it's a
minimalist, secure, and no bloat system by default. Few other points:
its excellent documentation, clean source-code, and the awesome
community.

I like to read the source-code of OpenBSD to learn the internals
and mitigation approaches for issues like recent vulnerabilities:
Meltdown, Spectre, TLBleed, L1TF, etc. Their mitigation approaches
are good and clean. As they have added pledge(2), unveil(2), RETGUARD,
arc4random(3) as one of the best PRNG and other features to improve
security and to make an attacker's life difficult. All of that makes
this software project unique.

I learned the importance of perfect exploit mitigations because of
OpenBSD.  It is a perfect example of innovating at exploit mitigations
and system hardening practices.

I use OpenBSD as a desktop OS on my laptop and as a VPS server
provided by [OpenBSD.Amsterdam](https://openbsd.amsterdam/). OpenBSD
is my frist choice for any server facing public network.

I have BeagleBone Black running OpenBSD and three Raspberry Pi-3
running FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Linux. So I can recreate any setup I
want to learn something and easily tinker with them.

Before OpenBSD, I have used FreeBSD a little to taste the flavor
of BSD systems and to learn some system administration stuff on it
and also I have tinkered FreeBSD kernel and written some rootkits
for fun while reading "Designing BSD rootkits" by Joseph Kong.

My personal blog [bsdboy.ml](https://bsdboy.ml) is running on OpenBSD
too. It serves HTML files with httpd(8), sends and receive emails
with OpenSMTPD.
