# Wesley Mouedine Assaby runs OpenBSD

I'm Wesley Mouedine Assaby, a sysadmin living in Reunion Island,
for those who don't know, it is located in Indian Ocean, next to
Mauritius.

I met [OpenBSD] system at a training about _firewalling and SMTP
(Postfix)_ in 2006, it was OpenBSD 4.0. I was impressed by using
[pf(4)], it was elegant and simple as it is now.

So I brought OpenBSD to the company where I work&mdash;[Aise
Informatique](http://www.aise.re). We use mainly Microsoft Windows
and provide services based on OpenBSD:

- protect client's networks using pf(4),
- run [iked(8)] for road warrior users,
- host mail using [Postfix].

Now let me tell you about my personal projects.

I've published few articles in BSD magazine. Some of them in
[2014](https://bsdmag.org/download/201407-pdf/) and
[2013](https://bsdmag.org/download/2013/) archives. The most recent
ones:

- [Reinstall OpenBSD 5.7](https://bsdmag.org/download/bsdm) (2015)
- [Configure OpenBSD 5.4 Basic Services](https://bsdmag.org/download/bsd-22014-pdf) (2014)

Around the same time, in 2014, I've  published [a
book](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/449457) (in French).

As you can see I'm very passionate about this operating system. I
made [OpenBSD Jumpstart](http://www.openbsdjumpstart.org) to help
newbies. I moderate _Telegram community_, if you'd like to join,
just walk through the slides, there's an invitation link. :)

I'm using OpenBSD to learn things like Ruby and [ksh(1)] scripting.
I'm building a complete mail server solution based on built-in
daemons like [smtpd(8)] and [httpd(8)]. So stay tuned.
