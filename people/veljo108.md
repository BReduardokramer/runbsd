# Veljo Mrdakovic runs FreeBSD

I'm a Sysadmin/IT professional since 2004.  I have started with
Microsoft administration, but have quickly moved first to Linux
(mostly Debian) around 2006 and later to BSD (mostly [FreeBSD]).

I enjoy using old school Unix power tools like [awk(1)], [sed(1)],
[grep(1)] and working in shell in general. [vi(1)] rules. Simplicity
and reusability of such tools is what makes me go back to Unix
tools.  In present IT world that is always changing for better or
worse, there is a need to find long term tools that can be used
again and again in daily work.

I have been a happy Debian user for its stability and low system
resources as well as huge number of available packages.  However
I'm moving more and more towards BSD systems as they are so well
documented (manual pages are amazing), offer great set of tools by
default, and their performance is second to none.  BSD systems also
offer sanity and simplicity which is sadly missing more and more
in other systems.  Not to forget to mention privacy and security
by default.

In company where I work (an insurance company), we have been using
[pfSense] as main proxy/router gateway to internet for years, and its
performance is amazing and blows commercial products out of the
water.  I have also been using FreeBSD jails for multiple Nginx
jailed instances with static content, it works really well.  FreeBSD
is simply amazing regarding performance especially for network
services.
