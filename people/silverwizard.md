# Sean Howard runs BSD

I am a BSD user since I got fed up with my systems changing enough
to kill my workflow every single release. After my network tools
stopped working after an upgrade in 2010 I remembered people kept
telling me that if I was so particular I should try [OpenBSD]. My
plan was to try it out and see what happened. I used OpenBSD on my
laptop for several years, and began slowly all of my systems.

I currently run OpenBSD on my mail, web, XMPP, and media servers.
I have switched my laptop over to [FreeBSD] for now, in order to
get to know more of the BSD community.

Find me on [Twitter], on [obscuritus.ca], or on [the Federation].
