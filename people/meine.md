# Meine runs FreeBSD

I am a [FreeBSD] user since October 2017, choose FreeBSD because it
supports my old but well running i386 netbook, its robustness and
'bare bone' install. This way I can decide what software to use and
forget about the rest. Soon after my netbook experiment, I migrated
my main box as well and never regretted.

Primarily having a system that works in console, it boosts my
productivity. I mainly write and edit texts. _CLI is for productivity,
GUI is for socializing._ When starting with personal computers in
the 1980s, I wasn't a fan of the (MS-DOS) command line. But I
grew up and now I see the power and speed of it, appreciating the
Unix Philosophy --- doing one thing at a time and do it well.

Before FreeBSD I was a Linux Fedora user for about eight or nine
years. IMHO Fedora had the best support and forum in the Linux
world. As this distro became better over the years, it also became
noticeably heavier by ongoing high CPU use and fan noise. In fact
all major Linuxes grow (too) big, but my main concern was that they
would dump the i386 architecture. I use my hardware until it really
breaks down, my family members are the same (since they rely on my
admin skills). Obese growing systems also made me go to Linux when
my Windows box doubled its system size, worsening performance
back in 2007.

Over the years I got to appreciate the FOSS-way determining myself
what software and hardware to use. Keep using well working hardware
also has an environmental side to me: don't waste what does the
job. IMHO we need better software, not faster hardware per s&#x113;.
'Better' nowadays means more basic to me --- Vim instead of some
GUI editor, that kind of way. Back in 1990 I wasn't able to out-type
my 8 MHz Mac Classic, so why should I want a faster computer now?

I didn't look too much around in the BSD landscape. DragonBSD looked
nice but has no i386 support. Just to start _somewhere_, I picked
FreeBSD. It is the community, forum and excellent documentation
that make me stay, next to the reliability. With FreeBSD I never
had a broken system or freezing software, and that's great! Starting
with a black screen and not even a package manager, CLI was a bit
of a challenge. But with the patient and excellent help of the
Handbook and FreeBSD Forum, within a day or two I had a well running
system and I learned how all software is set and works together.
Besides, primarily working in console is a good training for my
brain. I still use the 'sh' shell without history to sharpen my
memory.

I use FreeBSD only on my own machines and educate myself in keeping
things running and improving. BSD may not be an easy start like
buying a working system in a box, but really provides an excellent
system for home desktop use.

If you want to reach me, just look for my name on [Twitter], [Mastodon],
the Vim-mailinglist or FreeBSD Forum.

Thanks!
