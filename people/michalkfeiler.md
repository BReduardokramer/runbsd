# Micha&#x142; K. Feiler runs BSD

I've been hearing about BSDs and Unix history and then the ZFS and
tidyness and stuff for years (if you asked an eleven-year-old me
what BSD was I could answer something, I guess). I'm not sure if I
ever experimented with it before I went to [UMK WMiI] and there one
of the main servers for students is a so-called _ultra60_, which
is no longer an Ultra60, but runs [FreeBSD] (and there's more FreeBSD
machines used there, although I just went there for one year and
will see how it will be at @UAM_Poznan). I went to uni in October,
in November I began experimenting.
