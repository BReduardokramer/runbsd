# Dave Vollenweider runs NetBSD

I started using [FreeBSD] in February 2004, but switched to [NetBSD]
in February 2005 and it's been my primary OS since. I've been a
sysadmin since 2009 but was originally a broadcast technician when
I switched to BSD.

The two things that I like about NetBSD are the developers favoring
stability over adding new features and that it's the most portable
OS on the planet. Currently, I run the `i386`, `amd64`, and `evbarm`
ports.  I used to run the `macppc` and `xen` ports.
