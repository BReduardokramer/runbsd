# Anler Hern&#225;ndez Peral runs OpenBSD

Hi there, my name is Anler Hern&#225;ndez Peral ([@anler]). I studied
Automatics Engineering back in Cuba but never finished and instead
I dedicated myself to learn how to program. I started ten years ago
at university with C/C++ but after that I have learnt PHP, JavaScript,
Ruby, Python, Common Lisp, Clojure, Scala, ML (the language),
Haskell, Elm, PureScript, TypeScript, and Rust. 

I heard _"BSD is for people who love Unix, and Linux for people who
hate Microsoft"_ and _"BSD is designed, Linux is grown."_. That
made me interested in BSD, first, and then in 
[OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/).

Currently I'm reading [Absolute OpenBSD](https://nostarch.com/obenbsd2e).
I have donated to the [OpenBSD
Foundation](https://www.openbsdfoundation.org/donations.html), and
I have migrated my personal server to OpenBSD. So far I'm delighted,
from the first instant ([afterboot(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/afterboot.8))
everthing feels simple, designed, documented:
[doas(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/doas.1),
[sendbug(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sendbug.1),
[acme-client(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.1), etc.

I've never read a man page before, but now in OpenBSD I read all
of them!  My journey is still at its beginning but I hope to get
far: I started with my server and the next objective is to completely
move my desktop setup (ThinkPad T480 with Arch/i3/Emacs) to OpenBSD.
