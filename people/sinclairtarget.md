# Sinclair Target runs BSD

I'm a macOS user, though in some sense macOS is all BSD under the
hood. Like many people, I've not bought a new Macbook in years and
I'm thinking about jumping ship. If I do, then odds are I'll end
up using something like [FreeBSD].

We have BSD to thank for so many things. There's _vi_, for one. I'm
a [devoted Vim guy] and I don't know what I'd do without the
development environment that I've been able to tailor for myself.
Then there's the TCP/IP stack, the Sockets API, and [OpenSSH]. Using
a BSD system is a chance to be a part of that rich heritage.

BSD is also supposed to be one of the simplest operating systems
out there, in the sense that there are no frills.  I think there
are huge benefits to running an operating system you can understand.

I work at a nonprofit that provides affordable housing in New York
City. It is a rewarding job, but the one downside is that the whole
organization is deep into the Windows world. So I've had to learn
how to develop software on a Windows machine. While there are some
nice things about Windows development, I've come to appreciate how
suited a Unix-like or Unix-derived system is for writing software.
In the Windows world, most Stack Overflow answers involve a series
of screenshots telling you which buttons to click.  A Unix-like or
Unix-derived system, on the other hand, is built around text. There
is no hand-holding, but that also means there are no secrets.

So if you're thinking about picking up BSD, particularly if you're
coming from Windows, then I urge you to give it a go. It will be
different, but maybe in a good way.
