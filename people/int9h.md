# Manuel Wildauer runs BSD

I'm a software developer from Germany delivered in 1983. My favourite
BSD is [OpenBSD] and I use it at home.

In 1998 I made my first experience with Linux. I played with it and
switched to Debian GNU/Linux after few weeks.  My first touch with
BSD was in 2006 and OpenBSD 3.9. People talked about it in some IRC
channels and I tried it out for curiosity.  I liked OpenBSD a lot.
It had a awesome community and a had good documentation. I used it
from Version 3.9 until 4.2. After 2 years, I switched back to Linux
for unknown reasons and for the last 10 years I never used OpenBSD
again.

Someday in 2017 I followed [Roman
Zolotarev](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/) on Twitter and saw his
tweets about OpenBSD. I saw tweets about OpenBSD from him day after
day and few weeks after I followed him I thought something like:
*Hey, I could also try OpenBSD again.*

I searched for OpenBSD stuff around the web and found articles like
[this](https://ggr.com/why-openbsd-is-important-to-me.html) and
[that](https://sivers.org/openbsd). I decided to download the current
release and install it on my ThinkPad.

My personal blog [wildauer.io](https://wildauer.io) is running on
OpenBSD too. Serving the HTML files with httpd, send and receive
emails with OpenSMTPD.
