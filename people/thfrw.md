# thfr runs OpenBSD

I am thfr and I'm probably not a usual BSD person. I'm in healthcare,
and work on electronic health record systems. My path to [OpenBSD][obsd]
was through a hobbyist interest in free software. I ran different
Linux distros on my personal computers on and off at first, invariably
leading to frustration over reliability problems with regular usage
and software updates (I still have an Ubuntu partition, and similar
problems still exist).

When I learned about *BSD, the underlying principles made sense to
me&mdash;joint development of kernel and userland, permissive
license, for example. In addition, cybersecurity concerns started
to become an almost daily thing in the news, especially [Heartbleed][hb].

This all made OpenBSD a very interesting proposition. And, unlike
[FreeBSD][fbsd] at the time, X11 and wireless worked out of the
box! First, I just tinkered with it, but eventually decided that
it fulfilled most of my needs for personal computing with up-to-date
browsers and LibreOffice. Video in the browser was an issue at the
time. I hadn't learned about using [mpv][mpv] for watching YouTube
videos, and there was a scarcity of games. Nonetheless, I decided
that I'd rather go with fewer features, but a more refined security
architecture (was about the time when [pledge(2)][p] was introduced).

Eventually, I used it for almost everything, but would still boot
into Windows or Linux for gaming. I started keeping a list of games
in ports and kept track of new additions. Over time I found many
open source games that were not available and started experimenting
with porting some of my favorites like [dxx-rebirth][dxxr]. While
I initially expected to only play the likes of [NetHack][nh] on OpenBSD,
I eventually found and tried [UFO: Enemy Unknown][ufo] (aka [X-Com: UFO
Defense][xcom]). Desite its age, it was the game that convinced me that
enjoyable gaming experiences are possible on OpenBSD.

Nowadays, I do almost everything on OpenBSD. _#openbsd-gaming_ at
[freenode][fn] and the [/r/openbsd_gaming][reddit] subreddit are
my go-to places for our small subculture that's enthusiastic about
using this great OS for more than servers and routers.

At work, everything runs on Windows and Oracle. However, I can do
most of my emailing and things like preparing presentations or
papers with my OpenBSD laptop.
