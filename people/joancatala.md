# Joan Catal&agrave; Pi&ntilde;on runs BSD

Hello, my name is Joan Catal&agrave; Pi&ntilde;on, I'm a 40 year
old computer technician working in my local Government in
Val&egrave;ncia.  I work giving support and technical advice to
more than 115 municipalities in my province. The city councils,
information technology in public entities, the National Security
Plan and security are a fascinating world.

At work, we use GNU/Linux servers under VMware structure and we
share programs under Citrix Receiver. But I use [FreeBSD] in some
developments environments, also on my Raspberry Pi and [OpenBSD]
on my laptop daily.

I falled in love with Unix way of life many years ago, I started
using [HP-UX] working five years at [Hewlett Packard] in Barcelona.
I also started using FreeBSD and OpenBSD as a server and desktop
operative systems.

Nowadays, my daily desktop is OpenBSD 6.3 on my i5 Levono ThinkPad
X250 and it works like a charm, I really enjoy OpenBSD because it
is fast, stable. Also GNOME 3 looks really beautiful. My normal
desktop could be using Mozilla Firefox, Mutt and GnuPG, GIMP,
Stellarium, LibreOffice, VLC, MPlayer, etc.

I write post about BSD systems (and other stuff) regularly on [my
personal website],  please visit it and spread the word. :-)
