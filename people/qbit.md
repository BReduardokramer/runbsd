# Aaron Bieber runs OpenBSD

My name is Aaron Bieber (abieber), I am a software developer mainly
working with Go. My favorite BSD system is [OpenBSD] and I have been
using it as my primary machine for roughly eight years.

There are many reasons why OpenBSD is my favorite, but it all started with
[ifconfig(8)]!

ifconfig(8) on OpenBSD lets users configure hard-wired, as well as wireless
interfaces. This might seem like a trivial reason to pick OpenBSD as my fav,
but I assure you, the reasons are far more than cosmetic!

In my mind, having a cohesive interface exposed to users represents an
overall clean engineering process. It means the problem was well thought out
and the implementation was put together with a great deal of care and
understanding.

After the initial draw from ifconfig(8) my assumptions about clean
engineering were further confirmed by the sheer simplicity of the system.

Simplicity has huge benefits in my book:

  - It makes things more accessible. The learning curve is reduced.
  - It makes things easier to secure. Bugs can't hide in code that doesn't
    exist!
  - Simple things are easier to document.
  - ... The list goes on!

Flash forward to today: I use OpenBSD on as many machines as I possibly can!

My main system currently runs [cwm(1)] with a Firefox window and a single [xterm(1)]
with [tmux(1)]. My current editor of choice is neovim, though I dabble in emacs
when I want to keep my brain (and fingers) elastic!
