# ols runs BSD

ols is a distinguished technologist whose topics of expertise include
[OpenBSD], automation, chaos and resilience engineering, and Nerf
warfare.

Interested in technology (specifically how it breaks) from a young
age, his first foray into !windows was in 2003 when, while blindly
following the installation instructions in Sams Teach Yourself Red
Hat Linux, he upgraded his dad's Windows XP machine to Red Hat 9.
This resulted in him getting his own computer, so has been widely
regarded as a good thing.

He made the jump from Linux to BSD around 2014 and hasn't looked
back. Realistically everything he needs to do on a daily basis can
be done through the console, and so that's what he does. His ThinkPad
X61s serves him well still after all these years and currently runs
OpenBSD. He counts vim, irssi, mutt, and git among his favourite
software.
