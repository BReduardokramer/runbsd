# Jovica Ilic wants to try OpenBSD

I got involved in IT when I was 15, when I started learning Pascal
and Delphi. Soon after that, some of my programs managed to get
their way to the most popular IT magazines in Serbia. That was a
big thing back then.

While being at the university, I totally moved out from the Windows
world, and dived into learning about networks and Unix/Linux world.
Today I work as a sysadmin. I am a big fan of Vim and Gentoo.

Together with my sysadmin team at [adjust], we manage 400+ bare
metal machines, all running Gentoo. Gentoo allows us to fine tune
our machines and software we use for extreme performance. We process
around 10PB of data monthly. At this scale, whether it's about our
Aerospike cluster, PostgreSQL or Redis, we're faced with very
interesting challenges.

Until last year, I used to run Gentoo on my MacBook Pro. However,
I got tired of patching the kernel with every new version just to
have brightness control or sleep features working. So I moved to
ThinkPad X1 Carbon (5th gen). Linux support is great, the hardware
quality is good and it's very lightweight&mdash;so I'm pretty happy
with it.

So my current setup looks like this: Gentoo running on X1, with
i3wm. I use oh-my-zsh, and I love the abbreviations feature. Other
tools I use on a daily basis are git, tig, ack and
[todolist](http://todolist.site/). I use Chrome for browsing the
internet, where Vimium extension is a must.  I don't use mouse.
Most of the stuff I do just using keyboard, as I find it the most
efficient. While at work, I occasionally use my external screen,
Dell UltraSharp U3415W.

My favorite text editor is Vim. I even wrote [a book about
it](http://jovicailic.org/mastering-vim-quickly/). I wanted to
improve my Vim skills quickly, but I didn't want to read 250+ pages
books on Vim. I wanted less info, but the best bits.  There was no
such a book, so I had to write one.

> "I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long
one instead."<br>&mdash;
Mark Twain

As Mark Twain suggested, I think writing a shorter book requires
more mental effort than writing a longer one&mdash;particularly if
you want it to be good. Distilling the essence of what you want to
say and making the effort to cut out the fluff or just another way
of doing XYZ in Vim, requires a lot more cognitive effort.

The fact that I've read more than 300 of books in last the 4 years
helped me a lot in that regard. That's how my book on Vim ended up
with a chapter on best learning strategies known to me. I also put
a lot of thought into the structure of the content, so the beginners
don't feel intimidated with complexity. Instead, through a good
structure, I provide some sort of guidance and try to motivate the
reader to keep with reading and try out stuff.

I wrote [Mastering Vim
Quickly](http://jovicailic.org/mastering-vim-quickly/) using Vim
(of course!), entirely in Markdown. I used Pandoc with a bit of
LaTeX to convert Markdown to pdf/epub/mobi formats. I also have a
free weekly newsletter on Vim, available at
[masteringvim.com](http://masteringvim.com/). I regularly tweet
short Vim tips & tricks via
[@MasteringVim](http://twitter.com/masteringvim). You can also reach
me [@jovica](https://twitter.com/jovica). From time to time I write
a blog posts at [jovicailic.org](http://jovicailic.org/).

For a while already I'm thinking about seriously trying out [OpenBSD],
but due to lack of free time and/or motivation, that still didn't
happen. Following [@romanzolotarev] definitely increases my motivation
for this adventure. :)
