# Niels Kobsch&auml;tzki runs BSD

I am a system administrator for Unix and Linux systems. In my leisure
time I dabble in cardistry, podcast about retrogames and play
tabletop RPGs.

My favorite BSD is [OpenBSD][obsd] because it has a focus on security
and a great documentation. But I also use [FreeBSD][fbsd] a lot
when I have a need for robust storage and want to use [ZFS][zfs].

I use OpenBSD on a couple of servers like my private mail server
or my [ZNC][znc]. My netbook also runs OpenBSD because it just
doesn't need a lot of resources and comes already with a great base
system.

When you need a server and either need ZFS with native support in
its most advanced version or want a pretty much secure by default
system FreeBSD (ZFS) or OpenBSD (security) can be a great choice
for your server operating system in your IT environment.

[My blog][blog] runs on a FreeBSD-server, my private mail-server
and ZNC-server are OpenBSD-machines.
