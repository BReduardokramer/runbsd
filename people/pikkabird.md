# Hans Solo runs OpenBSD

<p class="quote">&#8220;Secure, stable, clean and correct. That's
what makes <a href="https://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> my choice
of operating system. I'm currently not a system administrator,
developer or contributor to the codebase of any project. Instead
my interest in OpenBSD lies in making my computer a nice tool that
doesn't distract from what's important to me.</p>

I feel that life should be just a little uncomfortable and for the
computer it should demand some effort on my part to learn how to
master the system :)

It didn't start out this way. I used to be a mainstream computer
user and programmer for many years on Windows. But as the years
have gone by, my life has moved towards simplicity, even minimalim,
in many areas.  This search for simplicity has kept me looking for
better solutions in just about everything. I am a little restless
maybe, but with some zen to it, finding stillness in more places
as my journey continues.

On the digital side of things I used to be drawn to the Apple
seamless "it just works" ideal, and used and liked Macs, iPods and
iPhones. My first generation iPod with the mechanical scroll wheel
fulfilled those ideals for me, I still miss using it :) But in the
end I felt confined and somewhat tricked into focusing on the shiny
surfaces. The simplicity felt superficial.

I got into Linux at one point when I was trying to find a low power,
low EMF computer and got myself a fitPC3 LP and a nice Eizo monitor.
I tried different Linux distributions with that setup, first a lot
of distros that wanted to look good and feel like Mac or Windows
but finally I settled on Arch Linux with a tiling window manager.
Simple and clean and ran just fine for a few years.

The trouble I had with Arch Linux was that it was a rolling release
and since we're all drawn to novelty I couldn't stop myself from
frequently running "pacman -Syu", which often worked like a charm,
but sometimes caused dependency errors in some AUR-package I was
using and had me searching the net for solutions.

Eventually I got tired of this and felt that I hadn't come to the
end in my search for the right way. Privacy and security was on my
mind as well, and I didn't feel I could get that easily with
GNU/Linux. I began looking for recommendations on the most simple
and secure OS which also had a good project philosophy. Arch Linux
talks about simplicity, but since it is GNU/Linux it's a big mess
anyways :)

As a sidenote, but I think influential to my searching, I had become
interested in functional programming and felt that I had stumbled
upon another key to peace and happiness. I listened to Erlang
inventor Joe Armstrong talk about [the mess we're
in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4&t=1770s) and felt
more strongly than ever that we're heading in many wrong directions
in our computerized society. Functional programming led me further
in my thinking about correctness and security in computing.

When I began reading about OpenBSD I felt immediately intrigued.
Reading more and hearing presentations on the thinking behind the
project made me even more convinced that this might be it. The
effort put on code correctness, security and the informative man-pages
are very impressive.

Next step was to download the installer for OpenBSD 6.2 and try it
on my ThinkPad. Easiest and nicest installer I had ever seen! I
installed a few packages and got a running system in no time. I
transferred my dotfiles over and made the changes necessary.
Everything worked without surprises and made me feel in control and
at peace :)

Since I started using OpenBSD I have kept on building my system to
fit my needs. I'm slowly adding more textbased workflows built
around simple composable tools to just do the work and don't get
in the way. In a way I'm looking for solutions that make me want
to use the computer less. It should just be there and do what I
want when I need it to.

What I haven't done yet is tried OpenBSD on the server side. I use
a VPS that doesn't support OpenBSD and on my home server I use an
accounting software that only runs on Linux.

I feel very strongly about making our computers basic but powerful
tools again and I see OpenBSD as a stable base for this.

My current setup is the ThinkPad X201 I started with about a year
ago, OpenBSD 6.3, i3wm, mutt with offlineimap, qutebrowser, Firefox
or Chromium, mpv, ranger, vim, vimwiki and more.

Thank's for the word :)
