# Brenda runs BSD

Hi, my name is Brenda and I really like [FreeBSD] and [PfSense].
But I'm not a sysadmin but more like a very lazy user.

I ran into Linux first while at university. It was when it came on
a pile of floppy's. The height of that pile scared me so I did not
install it on my home computer. Yes, that was running MS-DOS at that
time.

In one of my first jobs it was on SunOS or Solaris that Netscape
Enterprise Server broke and with some help---oh, the community is
so important!---I hacked a new password file (actually just one
line) to fix it.

Before that time I had to free up some space on a SunOS machine
that was running out of resources. I made a large mistake. The
largest files I could find that had not been changed since installation
I removed. Of course the very first reboot did not get the system
up. I had removed some bootfiles. With help from friendly sysadmins
and an install CD the problem was fixed.

Did I mention that the BSD community is awesome! For example,
[EuroBSDCon] is not only for supersysadmins and developers or people
that run their business on or on top of BSD. It is just as much for
people that just ran into BSD! Just go.

Nowadays I'm in the middle of upgrading the PfSense running at home.

At the moment I'm using FreeBSD RELEASE. Mainly for e-mail and
sometimes shell access (bash). And I have to thank the sysadmin for
keeping it in shape!
