# Franz Bettag runs BSD

I am Franz Bettag and I'm a trained sysadmin and am mainly responsible
for keeping [anycast.io][a] (AS34868) and its servers and racks in
Amsterdam, The Netherlands, online.

I first got introduced to [NetBSD] in 1997 at age 13, while I
searched the Internet for alternatives to my RedHat 6 (I got the
CD with a C programming book), and also learned quickly about
[FreeBSD] and [OpenBSD] as well. FreeBSD stuck with me since then
and a lot of my work related infrastructure runs on it, but I keep
running OpenBSD on some laptops and NetBSD on two ancient SparcStation
IV.

I could never pick my favorite BSDs of the three, all have their
very own use case and fit their roles perfectly. FreeBSD being the
obvious allrounder and server OS (thanks to ZFS and network
performance). OpenBSD has its advantages not only in security, but
comfort! It takes your console's keyboard layout and makes X11 use
it by default. NetBSD being the clear winner when wanting to operate
on rare hardware, that hardly anyone is using anymore, while using
up to date software.

In recent years [HardenedBSD]&mdash;a security optimized FreeBSD
fork&mdash;has been on my radar and I have come to like it very
much as my FreeBSD replacement.
