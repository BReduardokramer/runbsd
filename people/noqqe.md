# noqqe runs BSD

I am [@noqqe ](https://twitter.com/noqqe) and I'm a system administrator
for Linux based Big Data deployments in market research by day and
[OpenBSD] lover by night.

I got introduced to OpenBSD in 2012 when I was starting a new job
in [Nuremberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg) and visited
the local Hackspace [K4CG](https://k4cg.org).

There were OpenBSD 3.1 and 3.2 posters hanging in the location; and
after a short period of time I asked what it's all about. I learned
a lot of things from OpenBSD people hanging around in K4CG. It was
the first non-Linux system I touched and I loved the simplicity,
the sane defaults and the security aspects.

Since 2013 my personal servers for mail, [blog](https://noqqe.de),
and a few other websites ([/dev/null as a
Service](https://devnull-as-a-service.com/),
[entbehrlich.es](https://entbehrlich.es)) are served by OpenBSD.

I'm a happy user ever since and always curious what great technology
OpenBSD folks come up with. That's why I started [Why OpenBSD rocks
&#x1F421;](https://why-openbsd.rocks/) in early 2019.
