# Kelly runs OpenBSD

I am probably not a typical BSD user&mdash;I have no tech credentials
(yet) and have never had a job that required me to do anything more
complicated than running Microsoft Office. But I've always enjoyed
tinkering with electronics. At some point back when netbooks were
the thing, I got one without an operating system already installed
and learned how to use Linux.

Fast forward a few years...I got married and my husband started
talking about this great OS called [OpenBSD]. I tried it and
immediately hated it because I couldn't figure out how to turn my
computer off. Everyone said "read the man pages" but at the time I
couldn't find anything under _poweroff_ or _power_. There was an
entry for shutdown but it wasn't for actually shutting down your
computer. I felt like I was in elementary school again&mdash;when
you ask the teacher how to spell something and they say, "Look it
up in the dictionary!" But how can you look it up in the dictionary
if you don't know how to spell it?

I went back to Linux but was never 100% satisfied with it. It always
felt a little sloppy, like it was held together with spit and chewing
gum. I tried OpenBSD a few more times. I learned a lot&mdash;that
my EXT4 external drives won't work with it, that there was some
command to switch between command line and X11 but I could never
remember what it was so I just boot into command line. I learned
how to find things in the man pages, the difference between doas
and sudo, and most importantly, `halt -p`.

Eventually, I grew to love OpenBSD and it is now my preferred
operating system. I use it on my laptop and my server. There are a
handful of things I cannot do in OpenBSD&mdash;sync Calibre with
my ereader, Android development&mdash;but I use it for everything
else. OpenBSD appeals to the minimalist in me. I am not necessarily
trying to get my computer to do more or have it run all the latest
fancy apps. I want something that will do what I need it to do with
a minimum of moving parts and extra dependencies.

OpenBSD feels both elegant and strong, like a well-oiled machine.
I still have a lot to learn, but I am glad I found it and persisted
past the first few hiccups.
