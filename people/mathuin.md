# Patrick Marchand runs BSD

I was introduced to programming later than most. It was only during
my second semester at university, where I studied economics, that
I started modifying one of my favourite video games, _Crusader
Kings&nbsp;2_. From there I was introduced to git and from git to
the wider open source programming world. 

I had so much fun that I abandoned economics and went back to Cegep
to study _Informatique de Gestion_.  While I probably should of
stayed in university and tried to get into computer science, my
program did feature a Windows system administration class that drove
me towards installing Ubuntu on my computer when I got home.

I used various Linux distros, but always felt there was something
missing.  It was far from stable and I didn't like where the ecosystem
was going. It seemed it would get harder and harder to understand
my systems as things went on. So I tried [FreeBSD] on a desktop and
was pleasantly surprised, but still a little underwhelmed.  I then
tried [OpenBSD] on a server and fell in love, it was easy to use,
easy to understand and seemed to be rock solid. Though I couldn't
plunge into BSD just yet, because of my Optimus&reg; enabled laptop.

Flash forward a year and a half later, I was still happy with my
server and unhappy with my laptop. So I bought a ThinkPad X1 Carbon,
and set it up with [OpenBSD] 6.1. And after reading through Michael
W. Lucas [Absolute OpenBSD], I swiched to [-current], which has
proven to still be more stable than Linux.

I'm now the happy owner of an OpenBSD VM, an OpenBSD laptop, an old
Arch Linux laptop and a [DragonFly BSD] desktop, so I can play with
_hammer2_.
