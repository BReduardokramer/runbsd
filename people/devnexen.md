# David Carlier runs BSD

Like many people I got immersed in computer, trying to program in
Basic back then, then getting my first PC later on. But it is during
2003 year I discovered Linux by accident, founding an old distribution
in a CD-ROM at work and decided to give it a try instead of
reinstalling (again) Windows 95. And was immediately attracted,
from the command line to the "all is file"/"do one thing but do it
well" spirit behind it. Plus for practical reasons, much closer to
the SunOS servers we ran in production. 

A year later or so I decided to give a go to [FreeBSD] and liked
the simpler approach, easier to use/compile from the source than
Gentoo, the proper separation of third party softwares from the
base and so on. Other BSD flavors like [OpenBSD], [NetBSD],.. came
shortly after.

After this, became a parent and stopped for a while all those BSD
in my sparring time but never really forgot them until I moved to
Ireland for a new position when it came back shortly after around
the time FreeBSD started to switch from gcc to clang in base.  

In the meantime my interest started to switch towards more and more
OpenBSD than FreeBSD but still enjoy using the latter in a professional
context, ZFS has still unbeatable features! 

And that was around the time I started to contribute to various
projects either useful for professional matters, from industry
renowned softwares as Haproxy, FreeBSD user land a little bit, PHP
and personal interests from various video games (various doom/quake
engines, barony...), OpenBSD ports and a bit the userland when I
can. Mainly porting (or make sure it still work) under OpenBSD.  At
last, I became a LLVM committer since May 2018, having ported couple
of sanitisers for FreeBSD and OpenBSD, improving a bit the static
analysis features too.
