# Jim Abercromby runs OpenBSD

Whats, up! My name is Jim and I am a retired United States Air Force
Master Sergeant since 2005, and then retired from the civilian
sector in 2013. I live alone with my wife and dog in New Jersey. I
pretty much do that or I am reading, cooking or riding my bike.

So I have been around computers all my life since my first exposure
to them via a Radioshack TSR-80 in 1979. I have also used  civilian
and [military
mainframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_Cyber#Cyber_70_and_170_series),
Amigas and Commodores.

In December of 1996 while living in San Antonio, TX, I was on IRC
using [Mirc32](https://www.mirc.com/get.html), Windows 95. I stumbled
into some hacker channel, and this guy was talking mad shit to me
about how real men ran Unix or BSD if they wanted to be real hackers
etc. I instantly became a man on fire and this totally blew my mind,
so later that night at Barnes and Nobles I found an [O'Reilly book
on Red Hat Linux](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565922129.do).
At first I was so clueless, I literally recruited the help a doctorate
student from the nearby uni to help with installation. When we were
finished in a strange way I was underwhelmed because I was like.
"OK, I can do a ['ls'](https://www.unix.com/man-page/redhat/1/ls/)
what do I do now?" A few months passed by and I was PCSed to [Aviano
Air Base](https://www.aviano.af.mil), where I hooked up with a local
ISP, and then had to endure hours on irc with profanity laden rants
of RTFM, tough-love, and outright abuse on how to succesffully
configure my dial up scripts. At this point I learned to compile
the kernel source by hand as well and other linux tasks etc. My
first time of feeling like a god, hahahahahaha. I was proud.

I first installed [OpenBSD] version 2.5 which the release date was
in May 1999. Prior to this I was a Linux zealot, obsessed with GNU,
and Open Source concepts and ideology. I was stationed in Italy at
the time, so everything was done over a modem or you actually mailed
off and bought the CDs. Unfortunately I cannot recall accurately
whether I was successful at the onset of using my modem with OpenBSD,
but now the thought occurs to me that I was using [FreeBSD] with
my modem so yes I do now know for sure that I did have connectivity
via OpenBSD on the modem.

At this time I was using both OpenBSD and FreeBSD for my go to
Desktop and I turned one of my troops on to it at work, and he
installed OpenBSD on a Sun Sparc Station but I have no idea nor
recollection of what we used it for if anything. The United States
Air Force was not down with us just doing guerrilla installs and
deployments of Unix Like Operating Systems into "Production" so
when we did it it had to be a perfect and instantly working use
case of which we had none for that box. But it sure was cool to
dick around on for the time being.

My first very real use case was just learning [Packet
Filter](https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf), and configuring a correct
and robust rule set to protect my home network in 2001. I always
loved to buy the Shirts and listen to the songs, and to be honest
the packaging for the CD sets was impeccable. _Back in those days
I felt so "l33t" to be a desktop user of OpenBSD, and being somewhat
immature in this context was drawn in by the "OpenBSD" user mystique,
and also the legendary status of the project's leader and all the
main software projects that it produced SSH, OpenBGP etc. etc._ But
these are all the WRONG reasons to advocate for an Operating System
to a certain degree.

From 1997&ndash;2001 I was stationed at [Aviano Air Base,
Italy](https://www.aviano.af.mil/). I passionately looked for every
opportunity to use Linux or BSD in various use cases. The first one
was I was able to recycle old Pentium desktops and HP Misc Servers
to run Debian and use them as slave backup DNS boxes. Then our
Netscape Proxy server kept dying a painful depth during the middle
of the day. This situation provided the perfect opportunity to
install FreeBSD and set it up to be our new proxy by deploying at
first Apache and using it in proxy mode, but then switching to
Squid.


I also did this in [AL Udeid Air Base
Qatar](http://www.afcent.af.mil/Units/379th-Air-Expeditionary-Wing/)
back in 2003 using FreeBSD for DNS and Samba.

While I was in the Air Force from 1985&ndash;2005 I had done
everything from work on
[Teletypes](https://sites.google.com/site/mdprcp/autodinterminals),
Mainframes, MS Exchange and File Servers, to the Network Security
Perimeter (e.g. Firewall, Intrusion Detection, Perimeter/Edge
Routers, Proxy). When I retired in 2005 for 5&ndash;6 years I worked
for "Cash" doing network penetration testing for the DoD and USN,
and then Web Application Security for Vonage. I also held a few
"Certifications" (sic) such as Cisco CCNP, Security+, and SANS G542
Web Application Security Pen Tester. In the end it's all **bullshit**
though. Our country says we desperately need more Information
Technology Professionals in the Free Market (sic) but the cost and
business model for the certifications themselves is almost prohibitive
unless you are already employed. Almost everything you need to learn
is freely available on the internet legally.

In 2010 I became very incensed with [mini-itx](https://www.mini-itx.com/)
architecture and bought about 6 machines that I set up as routers
in my home to carry out various experiments with network design
using OpenOSPF and OpenBGP, but at this point in my life I was
already retired so I had no direct avenue of deployment in a large
production environment, so the project kind of died off. One my
dreams was to be able to run a BGP route registry using a router
built by myself and run it on OpenBSD. Once I started working at
Vonage, I became immersed in Web Application Security, and I figured
that while I loved being the router/switch and network guy. My
passion lied in learning to do webdev and code as well as doing sql
stuff. All you need is a laptop and a connection somewhere.

My only use case right now is running
[dethronedemperor](https://dethronedemperor.com) on a machine hosted
by Vultr. This box serves up my blog via httpd, and amce lets-encrypt.
Both applications are without a doubt top shelf military grade, in
the sense that they always deliver. At home I have a Lenovo Thinkpad,
my go to wm is of course cwm and also sometimes for de I run Xfce.
I write alot of posts, do javascript, java and python development.
I also listen to a ton of music and watch videos on YouTube on a
daily basis. Also something that I gave sparse attention to writing
this post, is that I am a big LaTex/Tex user, I have written many
college papers and resumes with this set of tools. LaTeX FTW.

My biggest wish right now regarding OpenBSD is I would love to be
able deploy it using [hostapd](https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd_gaming/)
but performance leaves it something to be desired as a viable use
case. Hopefully, down the road this will come to fruition. When it
does, I am on it immediately.

There is also an [Reddit subreddit for OpenBSD
gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd_gaming/), and this is
something I am really fired up about as well.  (Edit: What a pleasant
surprise there is a post by Adam Wolk here)

But I guess the main thing I still keep doing is writing, and coding.

OpenBSD is like an old friend, strong and long throughout the years.

A nerdy little surprise that comes and goes every six months.

I am glad that the Project never **compromised** and stuck to it's
guns, in all honesty I believe that most of the "other" Open Source
projects have been _sold-out_, and **commodified** in varying
degrees.

I have much **gratitude** that OpenBSD has never bowed down or
compromised it's core values.

So I am an old crow (54) retired, I use OpenBSD daily in the house
rocking a Thinkpad. But there is a guy that I want to point at here
who's name is Denny and he a [OpenBSD Blog](http://polarwave.blogspot.com),
and I don't what what happened, hopefully he didn't fall on bad
times or pass on.

I also want to shout out to [Roman](https://www.romanzolotarev.com)
for graciously providing this opportunity to contribute and express
my experience and use of OpenBSD.

Most days I am in **Hermit** mode, but you can find me on [Mastodon
instance Fandom](https://fandom.ink/@dethronedemperor) and [Mastodon
instance bsd network](https://bsd.network/@dethronedemperor). I
truly hate social networks, but with some gentle prodding from
[Roman](https://www.romanzolotarev.com), I am giving
[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) at try and I am very pleased
thus far.

Some of my other strong interests atm are learning ed, tradition
vi, sed and awk.

Current reading: [The Bug Hunters
Diary](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593273851)

I read, do security research, try to learn more coding, and also
freecodecamp.com.

**If there is anything I can do please reach out, and I will gladly
see what I can do as part of this growing community.**

And lastly OpenBSD helps to ensure my **autonomy** as a human being.
