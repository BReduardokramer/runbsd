# 22Decembre runs OpenBSD

I run [OpenBSD] as an amateur and totally self-taught on my server,
my router, and my secondary laptop, using isotop, which is an OpenBSD
distro made by [Thuban](https://framapiaf.org/@Thuban). I am active
on the [obsd4a forum](https://obsd4a.net/forum/), which is a French
forum for BSD enthusiasts run by Thuban. I am co-author of the book
"auto-hebergement sur OpenBSD" (self-host your server at home with
OpenBSD, in french), with Thuban again as the main author.

I wrote [some blog posts related to
OpenBSD](https://www.22decembre.eu/tag/bsd.html), one of them
explains how to maintain a DNSSEC zone with ldns and my script. I
write most of it during my free time as a hobby.

I like a lot all the security innovations ported by OpenBSD. To my
mind, most of them are just clear and simple ideas, like "randomize
the id of any process" or [pledge(2)]. Those ideas are plain and
simple, yet smart and security improving.

The simplicity of OpenBSD administration makes it easy to manage
for someone like me, who doesn't have any formal education in
computer field.

Once I've tried FreeBSD, but that was not convincing.

My server hosts my websites (mainly created using static generators),
my DNS and mail servers.

Next project is to (re)install my
[peertube](https://www.22decembre.eu/2018/07/01/peertube-en/)
instance with OpenBSD.
