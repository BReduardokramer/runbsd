# Guillermo Garc&iacute;a Rojas runs BSD

I'm Guillermo Garc&iacute;a Rojas ([@SoloBSD]). I am a Linux/UNIX
SysAdmin working in the industry for about 17 years.

I started on the late 90's using a Spanish Linux distro based on
Red Hat Linux 5.0 which I found in a magazine. Soon after I discovered
[FreeBSD] on Linux related magazines and I liked beastie, the mascot,
very much. I have to admit that mascots are very important for me
in taking the decision on what OS to use.

My first FreeBSD was 4.2 and used it until 5.0, when I got involved
with the [DragonFly BSD] team, and made the FAQ translation to
Spanish.  At that time I created the [SoloBSD website], to spread
the word about BSD to the Spanish language community. I started
using [OpenBSD] as a DHCP server for a small internet cafe I had.
I fell in love with this BSD cause it is super easy to install and
everything works right from the start.  OpenBSD documentation is
excellent, you have all you need there.

Next BSD was [TrueOS]&mdash;formerly PC-BSD&mdash;which I installed
in my super weird Acer Aspire&nbsp;E&nbsp;15 because it was the
only BSD at the time with support for my graphics card.

Then it came [HardenedBSD], which has the same support for my
graphics card on current branch and has many security enhacements.
For me, it was a perfect combination of FreeBSD and OpenBSD in a
single OS.  At that time I was very interested in very small systems
and started to investigate on how to reduce HardenedBSD to its
minimum. I found the [mfsBSD] project and created SoloBSD, which is
a small _mfs_ system based on the HardenedBSD code.

Since then, I am in love with HardenedBSD, I like the way they
project is going and enjoy very much having an ultra secure BSD
system.

Through my BSD journey I found that the BSD community is very
friendly that makes me feel at home. The documentation is very
straight-forward and you find it only in one place, you don't have
to be searching the whole internet to get official docs. And the
mascots are cute!
