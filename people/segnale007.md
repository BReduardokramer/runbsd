# Pietro Sammarco runs BSD

My name is Pietro Sammarco and I have been around the BSD world
since the year 2006. I was first introduced to Slackware Linux but
made the big jump to [FreeBSD] 6 shortly after.

I have been primarily using FreeBSD ever since, however I have also
been using [NetBSD] and [DragonFly BSD] on and off. What a like
about BSD in general is the simplicity of how things are designed
and done, the stability and high reliability of the systems, as
well as the support and communities built around their respective
projects.

I also appreciate its license, and because of it the fact that
nearly 90% of the IT industries nowadays relies on it. Whether is
Cisco, Juniper, Apple, NetApp, there are always BSD roots deep
within it.

I am mostly self-taught and driven by the passion for IT and new
technologies. During the past years I have been deploying NAS, web
server, firewall, VPN server, mail server, DNS server, DHCP server
and VPS server with Xen in SOHO.

My main interest in IT at the moment has shifted toward embedded
devices, and for that reason I have been closely watching the FreeBSD
and NetBSD project for ARM, ARM64, MIPS and MIPS64 development. I
have also done a full blown port (unofficial) of AlpineLinux 3.7
for the Raspberry Pi 3, and I have another coming for the Odroid
C1+. I do also run FreeBSD `-HEAD` on my Carambola 2 board, as well
as NetBSD 8 on the Odroid C1+.

Currently I am working as contractor for NetApp and I am primarily
involved in troubleshooting, break-fixing and deploying NAS, FC and
ISCSI solutions on ONTAP 7-Mode, Cluster Data ONTAP 8.3/9.X as well
as ONTAP Select.

**Features I like about FreeBSD and why I have chosen it as main
server OS**:

- Solid project with over 20 years of history
- Awesome documentation
- Amazing community and support
- Fast fix for critical vulnerabilities (usually)
- Fastest network stack
- Good hardware support
- ARM64 soon to be tier1
- OpenZFS
- Jails (perhaps the most essential feature for me)
- Dtrace
- Dom0
