# Jan runs OpenBSD

My name is Jan. I'm a security consultant who uses OpenBSD at work
and at home.  I started using [OpenBSD] about six years ago. Before
that I was a big Slackware fan (still am).  Somewhere in between I
also maintained packages for Void Linux.

My reasons for using OpenBSD are simple: I want a consistent, not
randomly changing, stable OS.  I further like that I can fix stuff
myself in OpenBSD.  I contributed to the [iwm(4)] driver, [httpd(8)]
and [kqueue(2)] and probably more that I can't remember.  Most of
the time I did these because I ran into an issue of some sorts.

I worked with reyk@, mikeb@ and jsg@ at [Esdenera Networks], that's
where I learned a lot of things about OpenBSD that I carried over
to my current employer [CIPHRON].

At home I build my router, firewall, redundant network connection
and server with OpenBSD.  Most of my time I spend in emacs (or
[mg(1)]), mutt and firefox with i3 as a window manager. I don't
have a lot of package needs and I generally don't like to install
a lot of software.

At work we are providing firewalls for our customers and I try to
push for a wider use of OpenBSD. Sometimes the lack of software
isn't helping, but most of the time the alternatives are great and
work the same after a bit of configuration and talking to the
customer.

I like to build my own tooling, before the recent Wi-Fi changes I
wrote my own wifi-manager in Lua. For daemons or tooling where
performance is important I like to use Rust, C, and Go.

You can find me on [Mastodon](https://x0r.be/@js).
