# Tim Chase runs BSD

My Unix journey began in high-school with access to a lab of [DEC
Ultrix][u] machines which, unlike Windows 3.1 and Mac OS of the
day, had real preemptive multi-tasking and native networking, giving
roaming `$HOME` profiles on NFS shares, FTP & telnet access, and
gopher & Spyglass Mosaic web browsing (and networked games like
Bomberman). It also didn't hurt that the screens had far better
resolution & color-depth than anything in the PC world.

In college, a classmate introduced me to [vi(1)][vi], writing all
his class papers and printing them on green-bar paper using the
line-printer in the lab. Though a little rough to start, it quickly
replaced my DOS editor `Q.EXE` as my default. Also around this time
I had a go installing both Slackware Linux (from an agonizing number
of floppies) and FreeBSD (2.x from a Walnut Creek CD-ROM) on my
486.

Out of college, I purchased my first laptop (a Gateway Solo 1200
with an 800MHz Celeron processor and 128MB of RAM which I later
upgraded to the maximum 320MB). However, the WinME with which it
came crashed frequently and needed regular updates & reboots. After
several reinstalls with Debian Linux, QNX, Minix, and several other
experiments, the machine currently runs OpenBSD 6.3 and still chugs
along.

It's hard to choose a favorite BSD. I like FreeBSD and HardenedBSD
for jails and the data-integrity that ZFS gives me. But I also like
OpenBSD for its aggressive security stance, light resource usage,
and the broad range of utilities available in a default install.

My home "lab" now has a mix of Debian Linux on a Lenovo, OpenBSD
(both on that old Gateway laptop and on a slightly newer [PPC iBook
G4][g4]), and FreeBSD (on a Dell [Mini9 & Mini10 netbook][mini]
maxed out with 2GB of RAM each, and on a discarded hand-me-down
Inspiron 1420 with 3GB of RAM). My Raspberry Pi Model B runs whatever
OS image I put on the SD card that day (usually Raspbian or FreeBSD).
Finally, I have a VPS instance with [OVH][ovh] onto which I've
hacked an (unsupported) instance of FreeBSD hosting jails that serve
email, some light database- & static-backed web work, as well as
some other temporary experiments like LDAP, IRC, and gopher servers.

In my hobby time, I goof off on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/gumnos), and run [@ed1conf on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/ed1conf) and [on
Mastodon](https://bsd.network/@ed1conf). I also do some development
on the side for a local non-profit, as well as lurk on Vim and
Python mailing lists, answering the occasional question.
