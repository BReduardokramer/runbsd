# Wylie Bayes runs OpenBSD

My name is Wylie Bayes and am a Security Engineer in the Government
sector. My favorite BSD is [OpenBSD] and I use it at work and for
personal use.

[pf(4)] is what really won my heart on OpenBSD, though I had probably
been using it for a short time before it's inception.  Primarily I
use it for training infrastructure I manage on the job, and at home
on routers, VPS, and workstations (ThinkPads).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wyliebsd) or at
[wyliebayes.com](https://wyliebayes.com).
