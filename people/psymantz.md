# Darryl runs FreeBSD

Started using [FreeBSD] in mid 1996, I believe at the time it was
FreeBSD 3.x - 4.x RELEASE. A friend of mine introduced me to it and
I gave it a shot. Couple of installs later... I was loving it.

What I liked about it was the RC system. The simplified flat-file
configuration files makes configuring the entire system a breeze.
The entire system would be up and running in minutes.

Secondly was IPv6, as back then it was still experimental and I
wanted to find an OS that had a solid IPv6 stack. Turns out FreeBSD
had it at the time and it was rock solid.

Many moons later, I find myself using FreeBSD on different types
of servers, mainly email servers, IRC servers and dedicated shell
hosting servers. These servers lasted a few years without reboots
and still performed like it was day 1. That puts a smile on my face
:>

Fast forward to 2010 onwards I've shifted to using FreeBSD on the
cloud, mainly on DigitalOcean and Vultr to run email and web servers
for my clients.

The way it is upgraded now (FreeBSD 11.x-RELEASE) is so much easier,
both _package_ and _src_. You can upgrade a server and it can be up
within minutes. 

A big thanks goes out to all the contributers and the FreeBSD team
to make this a long lasting rock solid OS that will continue to
serve us for years to come.
