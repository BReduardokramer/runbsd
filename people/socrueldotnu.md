# Lars Witterbrood runs FreeBSD

I am Lars Wittebrood. I live and work in the Netherlands and have
[FreeBSD] as a hobby!

I got introduced to [Slackware] back in 1994 through a school
project. Then a few years later, around 1998, I got introduced to
FreeBSD by a friend. He had set it up as a dialup router and firewall
for his home internet connection. These were still the dial up modem
days. I found it very interesting, so we setup the same at my place!
My love for FreeBSD was born!

In 1996 I started my professional life at a Dutch IT company. I got
training for the Microsoft MCSE certification for free and after
passing all exams I got to choose were to work in the company as a
Microsoft system engineer.  Soon Unix and Linux knowledge was needed
as well. Luckily I already started that at home in my spare time.
And through the professional ask I got more and more into Unix,
which I liked. Soon I managed Linux, Solaris, AIX and even SCO Unix
systems professionally.

In 2001 I registered my own DNS zone on the internet for private
use: `socruel.nu`. This got me to do even more stuff with FreeBSD!
The other new technology which lifted my home lab time was
virtualization.

I started a new job as pre sales technical infrastructure architect
in 2004 (and am still doing this today with 'the cloud' added into
the mix). This move finished my professional engineer days, but I
kept my love for FreeBSD. More and more functionalities were added
to it, so I could use it for even more stuff! I could i.e.  get rid
of my Linux based hypervisors! My FreeBSD hobby still supports my
professional life today!

Today I have 3 FreeBSD physical servers running at home with [bhyve]
and [ZFS].  These servers run approximately 20 VMs, also all running
FreeBSD. My home lab also includes a physical [pfSense] appliance.
And then I have some FreeBSD based VMs running at 2 VPS providers.

Functionalities running on this infrastructure are:

- NTP
- DNS (internal and external)
- e-mail (mailbox)
- mail gateway
- web servers
- firewall
- VPN (client to site and site to site)
- proxy (reverse and forward)
- infrastructure monitoring
- Network Security Monitoring
- management

A [FreeNAS] box is still missing in this picture. But it is on the
roadmap and hopefully I will have one later this year!
