# Jason Barbier runs BSD 

Hi I'm Jason Barbier, I am a bit of a jack of all trades, part
developer, mostly system admin, a long time gamer, and BSD home
labber.  For my laptop and the base core of my home lab I use
[FreeBSD], It is also what I have recently started doing work on
since I found it the easiest to find a place to start to contribute.
As for the rest of my home lab I have a little bit of everything
including a [OpenBSD] network gateway and a [HardenedBSD] Tor relay.

What got me started with BSD is the same thing that got me started
with pretty much everything computer, frustration and curiosity.
The journey starts with win 2000, the short version of that was I
lost about 20 gigs of MP3s thanks to NTFS and I had enough of Windows
shenanigans after that and in a fit of rage after a few months of
curiosity poking at Linux I went down the Linux path.

Fast forward a few years and just dependency hell, killing my install
more than once trying to install simple things, and just the design
or lack there of made me go looking and I tripped on OpenBSD and
just moved on to FreeBSD from there before VMM was a thing.  My
curiosity generally requires me to be able to run VMs, since I love
to try and pick apart machines and systems to see how they tick,
so FreeBSD sort of just stuck.

So come all the way to today and that love and curiosity of systems
and how computers work got me interested in trying to give back and
share my knowledge and maybe contribute here and there, so I have
been working on topics around how I have set my BSD home lab up and
trying to put content out around that, and trying to start learning
how to update ports.

My main machines right now consist of:

- PCEngines APU2 running OpenBSD.
- Raspberry Pi 3 running FreeBSD 11.2.
- Two HP Z220 Xeon-E3 workstations running FreeBSD HEAD using base
  packages, this guy runs a large assorment of VMs and jails to
  provide services and let me test things.
- Lenovo T420 Core i7 Laptop running HardenedBSD and Tor in a jail.
- Lenovo T430 Core i5 Laptop running FreeBSD, Im currently using
  this guy to see if I can figure out how to add 802.11n support
  to the iwm(4) driver.
- ThinkPad X1 Carbon 6th Gen Core i7 UltraBook, this is my main
  driver and runs FreeBSD HEAD using base packages.  It is a
  frankenstien of an install but it works well and I get a nice
  solid average of 10 hours of battery out of it.

And yes... I do have a problem, my partner takes every chance she
can to remind me of how many computers I have.
