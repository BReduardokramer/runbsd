# Trix Farrar runs FreeBSD

I'm a SysAdmin focused on infrastructure. I started with Linux
running DHCP and web servers. When Red Hat Linux gave way to RHEL,
I started auditioning other OS's; Linux distros,
[NetBSD](https://netbsd.org/), [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/),
and [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/).

I am a FreeBSD User. I like the documentation and the Ports
infrastructure.

While my laptop is Linux (because I need Flash for Citrix (don't
ask) and older remote consoles/VMware), the rest of the computers
in my house run FreeBSD.

At home I have an NTP stratum, redundant DHCP and DNS servers,
CFEngine for config management all tied together with Subversion
repositories.

At work, FreeBSD runs the OpenLDAP authentication infrastructure
There is a plan to migrate DHCP to FreeBSD, as well.
