# Wesley Moore runs BSD

I'm a software developer from Melbourne, Australia. I got my
introduction to UNIX when I started university in 1999. I was amazed
that the Sun systems there supported hundreds of simultaneous users
with uptimes of months at a time.

This prompted me to look into running UNIX at home. A friend had
tried FreeBSD so I thought I'd give NetBSD a go just to try something
different. I installed it on an old PC I had cobbled together from
donated parts. I was thrilled to be running, learning about, and
administering my very own UNIX system at home! A little while later,
I set up a FreeBSD machine to connect to our dial-up internet service
and share the connection on our home network.

For desktop computing I was a long time Mac OS X user up until
January 2017 when I switched my daily computing environment to a
combination of FreeBSD and Linux. I wrote about that experience on
my website, [Bit
Cannon](http://bitcannon.net/post/finding-an-alternative-to-mac-os-x/).

FreeBSD is my preferred BSD these days but I also like to dabble
in other BSDs from time to time. I have at times run a NetBSD VPS
and also currently run an OpenBSD VPS. My main machines right now
are:

- [i7-6700K FreeBSD Desktop PC](http://bitcannon.net/page/work-pc/)
  running on a zpool of three 250Gb SSDs, with GTX1050 graphics and
  4K display
- 2 core, 2Gb RAM FreeBSD VPS running on Digital Ocean
- [HP Microserver running as
  NAS](http://www.wezm.net/technical/2011/12/freebsd-zfs-powered-nas/)
  powered by FreeBSD
- 1 core, 256Mb RAM OpenBSD mini VPS running on RAM Host

The features of FreeBSD that appeal to me are ZFS, the stable base
+ rolling packages model, great performance, wide software support,
binary packages with security updates for stable releases, and the
permissive licence. ZFS is a huge deal for me. I like to know that
important data like photos is stored redundantly and with error
correction that will help prevent that data being damaged over time.

You can find me writing about my operating system adventures on
[Bit Cannon](http://bitcannon.net/), programming and other technology
on [my blog](http://www.wezm.net/), as well as on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/wezm) and
